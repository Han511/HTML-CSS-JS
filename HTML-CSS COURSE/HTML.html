        <h3>Types of conflicts are:</h3>
        <dl>
          <dt><i>interpersonal conflict</i></dt>
          <dd>
            <strong><i>Interpersonal</i> </strong>conflict refers to a conflict
            between two individuals.
            <br />
            This occurs typically due to how people are different from one
            another. We have varied personalities which usually results to
            incompatible choices and opinions.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <i>Intrapersonal conflict</i>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <strong><i>intrapersonal conflict </i> </strong> occurs within an
            individual.
            <br />
            The experience takes place in the person’s mind. Hence, it is a type
            of conflict that is psychological involving the individual’s
            thoughts, values, principles and emotions
          </dd>

          <dt>
            <strong><i>Intragroup Conflict</i></strong>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <strong><i>Intragroup Conflict </i></strong> a type of conflict that
            happens among individuals within a team.
            <br />
            The incompatibilities and misunderstandings among these individuals
            lead to an intragroup conflict. It is arises from interpersonal
            disagreements (e.g. team members have different personalities which
            may lead to tension) or differences in views and ideas (e.g. in a
            presentation, members of the team might find the notions presented
            by the one presiding to be erroneous due to their differences in
            opinion).
          </dd>

          <dt>
            <em> <strong>Intergroup conflict</strong></em>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Intergroup Conflict takes place when a misunderstanding arises among
            different teams within an organization. For instance, the sales
            department of an organization can come in conflict with the customer
            support department.
